      <b style="font-size:20px">Hi, I'm Hannah Kang! </b><br><br>

      <p>I am a Junior at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing both Fine Arts and Human Computer Interaction with a minor in Design. This past summer I joined <b><u>3M </b></u> as a UX Design Intern for the Healthcare Department on the Oral Care Team.  Last summer, I was working for <b><u>Samsung</b></u> as a Visual Design Intern for the Mobile Application team creating/iterating a super cool application that will be launched in 2018! <br><br><br>

      I am passionate about creating innovative designs that tackle complex problems. I find a certain fascination with the idea of developing worthwhile experiences for individuals. To me, the design process is enjoyable due to its intertwined relationship between the experiences people have with art. I treasure helping others discover depth in meaningful prototypes. I want to impact the world one step at a time through valuable ideas! <br><br><br>
 

      I can usually be found documenting my life in photos, doodling, or having ice cream !
